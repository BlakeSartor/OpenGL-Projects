Editing the sky implemented

    Added SkyStroke() function propely implemented to project 2D mesh onto the 3D sphere

Editing the ground implemented

    1. Projection plane defined.
    2. 2D stroke projected on the screen into the projection plane to create the silhouette curve.
    3. Looping through each vertices of the ground mesh and adjusting the y-value of each vertex according to our algorithm presented in the Harold reseach paper.
